## 1. Service Description

Jotil Chat provides an embeddable AI-powered chat widget ("Service") that businesses ("Clients") install on their websites to assist their visitors ("End Users") with questions. The Service uses third-party AI models to generate responses based on information the Client provides.

## 2. Acceptance

By subscribing to or using the Service, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 3. Client Responsibilities

- You are responsible for the accuracy of the business information, prompts, and reference content you provide to configure your chatbot.
- You must not use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to generate content that is harmful, deceptive, or violates the rights of others.
- You are responsible for informing your website visitors that they are interacting with an AI assistant, not a human. The default widget behavior identifies itself as AI when asked, but you must not override this behavior.
- You must ensure your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction, including consumer protection and data privacy regulations.

## 4. AI-Generated Content

Responses generated by the Service are produced by third-party AI models (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic). Jotil Labs does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness of AI-generated content. You acknowledge that AI responses may occasionally be incorrect or incomplete. Jotil Labs is not liable for decisions made or actions taken based on AI-generated responses.

## 5. Service Availability

We aim to keep the Service available at all times but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The Service depends on third-party infrastructure (Vercel, Supabase, AI model providers) and may experience downtime due to factors outside our control. We will make reasonable efforts to notify Clients of planned maintenance.

## 6. Payment and Billing

- Subscriptions are billed monthly. Payment is due at the start of each billing period.
- Message limits are based on your selected plan. If you exceed your monthly message limit, the widget will stop responding to new messages until the next billing period or until you upgrade.
- We reserve the right to change pricing with 30 days written notice.
- Refunds are not provided for partial months of service.

## 7. Cancellation

You may cancel your subscription at any time by contacting us. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Upon cancellation, your widget will stop functioning and your data will be retained for 30 days, after which it will be permanently deleted.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Jotil Labs is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the Service in the 3 months preceding the claim.

## 9. Modifications

We may update these terms at any time. We will notify Clients of material changes via email. Continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.

## 10. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms or use the Service in a manner that harms other Clients, End Users, or the Service itself.

## 1. What We Collect

### From Clients (Business Owners)

- Account information: business name, email address, website URL
- Configuration data: chatbot settings, system prompts, reference content, branding preferences
- Payment information: processed by Stripe. We do not store credit card numbers.

### From End Users (Website Visitors)

- Chat messages: the text content of messages sent by the visitor and responses generated by the AI
- Anonymous visitor identifier: a random ID stored in the visitor's browser (localStorage) to maintain conversation history across sessions. This is not linked to any personal identity.
- Technical metadata: page URL where the chat occurred, timestamp, browser type. No IP addresses are stored in our database. IP addresses may appear in server logs managed by Vercel and are subject to Vercel's data retention policies.

### What We Do Not Collect

- We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personal contact information from End Users unless the Client has enabled a lead capture form (future feature, not yet available).
- We do not use cookies.
- We do not track End Users across websites.

## 2. How We Use Data

- Client data is used to configure and operate the chatbot service.
- Chat messages are stored to provide conversation history, enable the Client to review interactions, and improve the chatbot's performance.
- Chat messages are sent to third-party AI model providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) to generate responses. These providers process the data under their own terms and privacy policies.
- We do not sell or share data with advertisers or unrelated third parties.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The Service relies on the following third-party providers. Each has its own privacy policy:

- **Vercel** (hosting): https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy
- **Supabase** (database): https://supabase.com/privacy
- **Stripe** (payments): https://stripe.com/privacy
- **OpenAI** (AI model provider): https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
- **Anthropic** (AI model provider): https://www.anthropic.com/privacy
- **Google** (AI model provider): https://policies.google.com/privacy

## 4. Data Retention

- Chat messages are retained for the duration of the Client's active subscription.
- Upon cancellation, all Client data and associated chat messages are retained for 30 days, then permanently deleted.
- Clients may request early deletion of their data by contacting us.

## 5. Data Security

We use industry-standard measures to protect data, including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS), access controls on database systems, and secure storage of credentials. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Client Obligations Regarding End User Privacy

Clients are responsible for their own compliance with privacy laws (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable regulations). If your jurisdiction requires it, you must disclose the use of an AI chatbot and the collection of chat data in your own website privacy policy.

## 7. End User Rights

End Users who wish to request deletion of their chat data should contact the Client (the business whose website they interacted with). Clients can then contact us to delete the relevant data.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy at any time. Material changes will be communicated to Clients via email. The updated policy will be posted at our website with the new effective date.
